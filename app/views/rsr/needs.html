      <p>This question is concerned with the individual’s pattern of drinking, rather than the frequency or level of consumption.</p>
      <p>Binge drinking is defined as drinking too much alcohol over a short period, for example, over the course of an evening. It typically leads to drunkenness. It has immediate and short-term risks to the drinker and to those around them.</p>
      <p>A binge is defined as consumption of more than twice the Government’s recommended daily limit in a single session (8 units for men and 6 units for women).  However, many binge drinkers consume substantially more than this, or drink this amount more rapidly.</p>
      <p>Binge drinking tends to involve periods of sporadic excessive consumption of alcohol interspersed with periods of relative abstinence. The individual may consume very little or no alcohol for days, weeks or even months, but will then drink large quantities, becoming quickly intoxicated. </p>
      <p>A binge may last for a number of hours or for a period of days. A common pattern is to abstain during the working week, but drink excessively at weekends. This pattern of consumption, involving periods of near abstinence or moderate drinking interspersed with binges, can be extremely problematic in terms of health and risk of reconviction.</p>
      <p>Consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the number of episodes of excessive alcohol consumption in the last 6 months</li>
        <li>how long the binges last</li>
        <li>whether the binges are a weekly occurrence - for example, when the individual gets paid - or if are they less frequent</li>
        <li>whether there is any pattern to the binges or if there is an identifiable trigger, for example, after visiting their children</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>No problems</strong></p>
      <p>The individual:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>elicits no evidence to suggest that they are a binge drinker</li>
        <li>has not started drinking excessively on occasions in the last 6 months</li>
        <li>does not drink alcohol at all or only drinks alcohol in moderation</li>
        <li>has previously had an alcohol misuse problem with excessive alcohol consumption or binge drinking, but has not consumed alcohol for over 1 year</li>
        <li>drinks on a regular basis, but does not have a pattern of binge drinking, even if their overall alcohol intake is at a level which may lead to problems</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Some problems</strong></p>
      <p>The individual:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>has a pattern of drinking, which could be described as binges, for example, drinking heavily at weekends, but this has not resulted in the serious problems described above</li>
        <li>does not see anything wrong in their behaviour - dismissing it as just ‘having a good night out’ or ‘letting their hair down’</li>
        <li>may spend beyond their means on binges and the binges may coincide with periods of offending</li>
        <li>has shown less frequent incidents of excessive drinking, if this appears to be an increasing phenomena and possibly linked to offending</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Significant problems</strong></p>
      <p>The individual:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>admits to, or there is evidence that they binge drink</li>
        <li>binge drinking has a detrimental effect on all areas of their life</li>
        <li>may have experienced drinking to unconsciousness, blackouts and being unable to account for periods of time when drinking</li>
        <li>may have missed work or experienced relationship difficulties due to this behaviour</li>
        <li>may be aware of the detrimental effects of their behaviour but be unable to stop, or they may not recognise the problem</li>
        <li>may spend all their available money on alcohol when binge drinking</li>
        <li>has binge drinking episodes that will often be directly related to incidents of offending</li>
        <li>has had several incidents of excessive alcohol use in the last six months, which do not amount to a binge pattern, but are ‘out of character,’ especially if these incidents were clearly related to their offending</li>

      <p></p>Consider:
      <ul>
        <li>if the individual has a low tolerance for frustration, poor resolution conflict skills, and loses their temper regularly and easily</li>
        <li>if they have a hidden disability, which may impact on communication, which can sometimes lead to frustration and loss of temper</li>
        <li>lack of temper control often leads to acts of violence</li>
        <li>how well the individual deals with negative emotions and frustrating situations</li>
        <li>A history of violent behaviour in itself does not justify a marking of significant problems or some problems. Many individuals use violence in a controlled instrumental way. Do not include individuals who describe themselves as angry but do not lose control.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>No problems</strong></p>
      <p>The individual:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>rarely loses their temper</li>
        <li>recognises events and situations that irritate them and deals with them effectively</li>
        <li>does not experience feelings of being totally out of control when angry</li>
        <li>does not become so angry that they have assaulted someone or damaged property</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Some problems</strong></p>
      <p>The individual:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>shows the same pattern of frustration and over-reaction as those who have ‘significant problems’ but with less frequency</li>
        <li>has infrequent bouts of uncontrolled anger</li>
        <li>has only one documented episode of loss of control (the current offence) and the interview fails to reveal any others</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Significant problems</strong></p>
      <p>The individual:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>has a history of regular outbreaks of anger</li>
        <li>admits to losing their temper easily. Others they associate with may be very wary of them</li>
        <li>has assaulted others when angry</li>
        <li>has smashed property</li>
        <li>when feeling angry, describes a total loss of control and an inability to remain calm until they have expressed their anger</li>
        <li>frequently becomes angry under specific circumstances or when disinhibited by alcohol or drugs.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the person’s attitude towards offending and criminality in general.</li>
        <li>note any beliefs that criminal behaviour is normal and acceptable.</li>
        <li>if the person makes broad generalisations to justify criminal behaviour such as 'everybody's doing it' or that victims 'only have themselves to blame'</li>
        <li>if they excuse the levels of offending in terms of wider general factors such as levels of unemployment, the government's policies, or inequalities in society</li>
        <li>are they anti-authoritarian, dismissive of the judicial and law enforcement systems?</li>
        <li>if they view those who abide by the law as being weak, inferior or foolish</li>
        <li>some people with a undiagnosed or unidentified condition (e.g. learning disability and/or challenges or an autistic spectrum disorder) might present with a more rigid way of thinking, which can easily be misinterpreted as unyielding and even anti-authoritarian.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>No problems</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>there is no evidence that the person allies themselves with a criminal sub-culture.</li>
        <li>the person’s views about law and order are generally positive and they recognise that the majority of people are law-abiding.</li>
        <li>the person recognises and respects the rule of law in general even if they demonstrate some distortions and minimisation around their own offences.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Some problems</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>expresses views supportive of general offending.</li>
        <li>there is some evidence that the person is involved in a criminal sub-culture.</li>
        <li>justifies their own behaviour by comparison with the misdemeanours of others.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Significant problems</strong></p>
      <ul>
         <li>expresses views favouring and excusing criminal behaviour regularly and with conviction. They may offer these views spontaneously during the interview.</li>
         <li>shows a great deal of antipathy towards the legal system and its agencies.</li>
         <li>strongly adheres to the views of a criminal sub-culture.</li>
         <li>When assessing men who have sexually offended under this item you need to be careful to avoid bias. People can commonly behave and act in opposition to their beliefs. This does not necessarily mean they have a generalised attitude that offending is acceptable. If someone sexually offends it does not automatically mean they believe that their behaviour was justified. </li>
         <li>People may minimise some of their behaviour by providing excuses and reasons, or minimising aspects, in order to: </li>
         <li>make it less painful for them to deal with</li>
         <li>so that others are more likely to deem their acts as permissible and tsee hem as morally redeemable people</li>
         <li>They may also maintain their innocence to protect their relationships with non-offending family others, which could have a role in supporting desistence. </li>
         <li>On the other hand, for a small number of people, maintaining innocence might be part of a strategy to retain access to potential victims, and so might be a risk factor. It is important that assessors determine the purpose that maintaining innocence might serve for the individual.</li>
         <li>Equally, maintaining innocence regarding their conviction does not necessarily mean the individual has pro-criminal attitudes, as denial can have many functions. It may serve to protect their sense of identity and of being ‘someone who would not do those things’ (i.e. they do not believe the behaviour is right) which is indicated as important for supporting the desistance-related change processes.</li>
         <li>Those with true attitudes that support sexual offending might in some cases find it difficult to contain them and so might share them with you. They may verbalise their views on the age of consent or a man’s sexual entitlement. Others may not share them because voicing such views might lead to them receiving further sanctions, or they realise they may be challenged over. </li>
         <li>Other evidence may come from observation of their discussion with other prisoners/residents about offence supportive beliefs or sayings. Any material collected during an investigation such as chat room transcripts and phone messages may also be useful. However, be mindful of the impact of peer influence: do they believe what they say or write, or do they offer it to fit in with peers? Where possible seek multiple sources and compare.</li>
