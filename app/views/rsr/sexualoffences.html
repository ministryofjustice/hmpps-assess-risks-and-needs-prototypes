Similarly, the same definition of ‘knowing’ should be used. ‘Knowing’ minimally involves having met, had a conversation with, and being able to recognise the other person. All three of these conditions must be met to classify as ‘knowing’. The exception to this is when two people have been communicating via a webcam/video-conferencing; in this situation, they may not have physically met, but could still be classed as ‘knowing’ each other."

        <li>Convictions related to intent or attempt to seek sexual contact with a live human being are considered within the contact adult and contact child offending groups. Any offending that involves causing or attempting to cause a victim to be involved in sexual activity without lawful consent can be considered a contact offence even where no physical contact has taken place e.g. within an online environment. This would include causing a child to witness sexual activity, because in this example there is an intent to cause a child to be involved with a sexual act. </li>
        <li>Offences with a sexual motivation that did not involve causing or attempting to cause a victim to be involved in sexual activity without lawful consent should be classed as non-contact e.g. voyeurism or upskirting.</li>
        <li>Class offences as contact adult if there are any victims aged 16 or over, or contact child if aged under 16.</li>
